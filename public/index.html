  <h1>Welcome to Mrs. Landi's Tutoring</h1>

  <h3 id="countdown">Countdown to Winter Break: </h3>

<div id="section1">
  <p>For new clients, I offer a 30 minute complimentary session for both parent and student, so we can meet before tutoring begins. Tutoring is at my house, on the Sammamish Plateau.</p>

<div id="section2">
  <p>While each student is different and some will require more support than others, for most students it works best to meet twice per week to lead to quicker and longer-lasting results. Students do best when they come for tutoring on a regular and consistent basis.</p>

  <p>As a tutor, I can reinforce the concepts presented in the classroom to ensure that your child is continuing to stay on top of new material, help your child with their homework needs, and work with their classroom teacher to provide additional lessons where extra support is needed. In addition to academic support, occasionally there is a need for help in developing good study skills and in providing a child with the skills for coping with test anxiety. As a tutor, I offer a wide spectrum of support, tailored for your child's needs.</p>

  <p>I look forward to working with you and your child during the school year and consider it a privilege to provide your child the tools for a solid foundation toward academic achievement.</p>
